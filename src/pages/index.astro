      <p>Happy 26 months to us baby!</p>
      <p>
        This is a little something I made for you. I hope you like it. We'll
        work on it together and make it really awesome. Every diplomat needs
        their own personal website!

        I‚Äôve missed you so much for the past 2 months. Life does feel like it‚Äôs
        on hard mode now but we‚Äôre gonna get through this and even come out
        stronger üí™üèΩ
      </p>
      <p>
        I wish you could be in Sydney so we could live out of home together but
        the time will come!
      </p>

        I‚Äôm so excited for this chapter of your life baby. I know you‚Äôre gonna
        do so many impressive things. You just have to believe!
